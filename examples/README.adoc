= Modshells Example Configurations
:toc:

Example shell configuration snippets for use with Modshells.

== Usage

Copy the snippets you want into your modshells directory:

[source,bash]
----
# Copy all examples
cp -r examples/* ~/.config/nushell/modshells/

# Or copy individual files
cp examples/tools/git.sh ~/.config/nushell/modshells/tools/
----

== Directory Structure

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Directory | Purpose

| `core/`
| Essential settings loaded first (PATH, history, shell options)

| `tools/`
| Tool-specific configurations (git, fzf, starship)

| `misc/`
| General aliases and utility functions

| `os/`
| Operating system specific settings (Linux, macOS)

| `ui/`
| Visual customisations (colours, prompt)
|===

== File Naming

Files are sourced alphabetically. Use numeric prefixes to control load order:

* `00-*.sh` - Load first (PATH, critical settings)
* `10-*.sh` - Load early (history, options)
* `20-*.sh` - Load later (depends on earlier settings)
* No prefix - Load in alphabetical order

== Customisation

These examples are starting points. Modify them to suit your workflow:

1. Copy the file to your modshells directory
2. Edit to add/remove aliases and settings
3. Restart your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`

== Shell Compatibility

These examples use POSIX-compatible syntax and work with:

* Bash
* Zsh
* Ksh
* Dash (limited)
* Oils (OSH/YSH)

For Fish, Nushell, or PowerShell, you'll need to translate the syntax.
See the main README for shell-specific sourcing blocks.
